* ChangeLog

** DONE Which web framework? Spock, Yesod, Snap, Scotty, Servant?
CLOSED: [2016-10-26 Wed 08:20]
Spock looks like the easier to understand, although changed my mind because Servant looks more interesting for APIs.

** Which templating library? Lucid, Heist, blaze-html, hamlet?
I'll start with Lucid, although no big opinion on that.

** Servant and static files

** Hello World with servant
https://github.com/mietek/hello-servant/blob/master/Main.hs

** DB library
It looks like Persistent would be a good starting point. There is also an example http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2015/06/07/servant-persistent.html

** TODO deploy to heroku
https://haskellonheroku.com/tutorial/


** TODO how to server static content
serveDirectory https://haskell-servant.github.io/tutorial/0.4/server.html
or nginx?
